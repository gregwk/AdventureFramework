 * The purpose of this class is to initialize the following scenario,

 * garage and kitchen. You start in the garage but need to go east to 
 * the kitchen. There is a closed and locked door in the way. In the 
 * garage you have a (closed) toolbox. Inside the toolbox is a key. 
 * The player has to open the toolbox, take the key, and unlock the 
 * kitchen door.
